Offensive Pass Interference (OPI): An eligible offensive player creates separation by pushing, initiating significant contact, or blocking a defender more than 1 yard downfield on a pass play before the ball is touched.
Exceptions: legal picks within 1 yard at/before pass if contact is incidental and within timing restrictions.
