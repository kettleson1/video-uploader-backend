Defensive Pass Interference (DPI): A defender significantly hinders an eligible receiverâ€™s opportunity to catch a forward pass beyond the neutral zone before the ball arrives. Examples: early contact, grabbing/restricting arms or body, playing through the back, not playing the ball.
Not DPI when: contact is incidental, catch is clearly uncatchable, or defender is playing the ball with minimal contact.
